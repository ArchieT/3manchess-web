# Who we are

We are a small group of students (with a teacher), who wanted to make a project
for the 16. Toruń Festival of Science and Art, but it emerged into something
more. All of us attend(ed) <a href="http://loiv.torun.pl" target="_blank">General Tadeusz Kosciuszko High School #4</a>
though one of us already went on to the university.

-   **Michał Krzysztof Feiler**, 2e IV LO — backend (game engine, AI, server), API, JavaScript client
-   **Paweł Zacharek**, student — backend: game engine, AI; some help with js client
-   **Patryk Kisielewski**, 2e IV LO — js/web frontend
-   mgr inż. **Damian Kurpiewski** (our CS teacher) — js/web frontend

With some technical help from my and Patryk's Computer Science teacher,
as well as "legal" (game rules) advices from Clif King, the creator of 3 Man
Chess, we have created a digital edition of the game.

The frontend we are presenting on this website is written in
JavaScript, and it connects to a gameserver hosted on a 
<a href="http://platinum.edu.pl" target="_blank">Platinum Non-Profit server</a>, written in Go.

We have used images of chess pieces
<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:PNG_chess_pieces/Standard_transparent" target="_blank">
from Wikimedia Commons</a>. Everything else, besides the game, which is itself
<a href="http://3manchess.com" target="_blank">patented</a>, is open source,
**but not free software — we are not willing to let anyone run their own
instance of the gameserver, web client, or distribute clients / offline-gameplay copies of this program.**
