## How do I play?

-   [Sign Up](signup.html) with your login, password and name
-   In the [game interface](play.html), enter your login and password
-   Either create a new game (optionally preenter PlayerIDs of yours and your opponents) or enter a GameplayID and click <kbd>Submit</kbd>
-   To switch to gameplays derived from the current one, click <kbd>After</kbd> and then select one from the list. You can also set up polling, which basically _clicks_ <kbd>After</kbd> every _n_ milliseconds.
-   To switch to a gameplay from which the current one is derived, click <kbd>Before</kbd> and then select it from the list. <i>If polling is on, <kbd>Before</kbd> might be overridden by <kbd>After</kbd> shortly afterwards</i>
-   To play, simply click on the figure you want to move, and possible destinations will highlight in green.
